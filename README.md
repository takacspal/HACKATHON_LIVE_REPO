###Kalmar Gabor’s theme:
No one reads the fine print (ie TOS, EULA, legal documents) anymore yet every site has them. Devise a creative/interactive solution.
No one reads the EULA and it’s hard to change this. With Gabor’s solution we wanted to make it easier to understand and improve its learnability.
According to many studies, listening to music while reading makes it easier to memorize, understand things, especially if you listen to what you’re studying.
Using an algorithm the EULA will be read aloud in musical environment.

###Takacs Pal’s theme:
Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization (e.g. climate change, earthquakes, food/water waste, accessibility related issues, etc) combined with HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented (multiplayer preferred).
Global warming is very serious problem even if we can’t really feel its effects yet. Our team wants to call attention to the problems we may face one day by the simulation-game Pal made. To avoid a very sad and bleak future, we need to invest more into using renewable resources.
Hopefully, we have made a difference.
